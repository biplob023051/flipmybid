This is the instructions for installing your Telebid Clone.

If you need help with these instructions email michael@feistysites.com

The install should look like the following site:
http://demo.feistysites.com

Please note: For significant performance improvements, install Zend Optimizer on your server.

Here are the instructions

1) 	Download the code (you have already done this if you are reading this!)

2) 	Move the code (if it is not already) to a folder in your webroot folder.  For example /var/www/telebid.
	If you are moving this code to a live server, copy the code into the public_html or httpdocs directory.

3) 	This step is only needed if the site isn't accessable from a domain name directly. e.g. www.telebid.com
	You need to set up a subdomain to access the site, so that the website URL is telebid.localhost
	For more information visit: http://blog.ubrio.us/gnome/how-to-subdomain-localhost-ubuntu-osx

4) 	The next step is to create your database and dump the SQL.  In the code under /app/config/sql import the
	file telebid.sql into your database.

5) 	Now you need to create your config file.  In app/config you will see a file called config.default.php.
	Rename this to config.php and fill out the details so that they match yours.  Turn demoMode to true for now.

6) 	Now you need to chmod 777 the following directories:
	/app/tmp
	/app/tmp/cache
	/app/tmp/cache/models
	/app/tmp/cache/persistant
	/app/tmp/cache/views
	/app/webroot/img/category_images
	/app/webroot/img/category_images/max
	/app/webroot/img/category_images/thumbs
	/app/webroot/img/product_images
	/app/webroot/img/product_images/max
	/app/webroot/img/product_images/thumbs

7) 	Now you need to create the following Cron Jobs.  We use CURL to access the URLs, but contact me if you server doesn't have CURL installed.
	These cron jobs should be set to run every minute, of every hour, or every day.  Make sure the cronTime in the config is set to 1 also.
	The 4 commands you need to set up are:
	curl -s -o /dev/null http://www.domain.com/daemons.php?type=bidbutler
	curl -s -o /dev/null http://www.domain.com/daemons.php?type=extend
	curl -s -o /dev/null http://www.domain.com/daemons.php?type=close
	curl -s -o /dev/null http://www.domain.com/daemons/cleaner
	curl -s -o /dev/null http://www.domain.com/daemons/winner

	If you are running the site on your local host, you can test these things by simply running the daemons directly on another browser
	and set the cronTime to say 10 to keep it running.

8)	You should now be able to access the website.  Register on the website, and your account will be set to admin.
	Once you have done this, turn turn the demoMode back to false.

Thats it!  Enjoy the code!
